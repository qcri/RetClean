Welcome to the official repository of **RetClean**, a cutting-edge tool developed by QCRI for data repair tasks that demand world knowledge. RetClean combines the power of large language models (LLMs) with indexed CSV datalakes to clean and repair datasets efficiently.

---

## Features

-   **CSV Upload**: Upload CSV files for cleaning.
-   **LLM-Driven Cleaning**: Perform standalone data repair using LLMs.
-   **Data Lake Support**: Upload and index CSV-based datalakes for contextual cleaning.
-   **Custom Configurations**: Choose indices, reasoner models, and re-ranker settings for tailored cleaning workflows.

---

## Tech Stack

RetClean is built using modern tools and frameworks:

-   **Frontend**: [React](https://react.dev/)
-   **Backend**: [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/)
-   **LLM Serving**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
-   **Indexing and Search**: [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/) and [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)
-   **Containerization**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

## Getting Started

### Installation

Set up RetClean effortlessly using Docker Compose.

1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project root.
2. Build the application using:

```
docker-compose build
```

    This will install the necessary services as well as the dependencies for the client and server.

##### Note

For the local model example available in the application, we use a quantized LLaMA 3.1 model pulled from Ollama. This may require you to increase the allocated max disk space from the default in Docker.

### Start

To get the application running, just run the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

The application hosted locally will run on port 3000:
[http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
